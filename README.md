### Planetary themed memory game: Whole Body interaction with Kinect

<p align="justify">Kinect games have been show to improve visuospatial abilities, attention, concentration, working memory, 
language, fluency, orientation, and multiple aspects of Executive Functions in healthy subjects. (Reinaldo,C et al 2021)

With the growth of interactive media on supporting executive functions, we decided to make a prototype of an interactive game where memory and the space are the protagonists.


It started with the development of the algorithm on Processing using the mouse as input.
